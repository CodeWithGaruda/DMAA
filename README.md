`gallery`

`form`

`member page`

member page this page should be able to viewed by member
idea of this page for now is that:

Don't think about backend at all focus more on UI/UX [definetly good looking]

1. members are able to view notifications [separate component]
   basically as a initial version we load notifications from a json file
   later we will get it from admin

2. members are able to post a video or an image just like facebook,instagram [a simple good looking component here]
   our aim for now is that a good looking ui dont think about backed
   we will integrat it later

3. give me more ideas for member page?

lets focus on these 4 components
makes sure all the 4 are components
for now load information from json
eg: member.json
{
notifications:{
1.asdfasdf,
2.asdfasdf
}
Quote:{
1.asdfasdf
2.asdfasdf
}
}
Personal training snapshot we will get from user details
